# AVMeetup

As developers, it is our responsibility to understand the goals and needs of our applications, and to resist the urge to over-engineer and prematurely optimize our solutions.

The decision to use Core Data in an application may appear to be a no-brainer, if not harmless. But in many cases, Core Data is discovered to be so unwieldy or unnecessary as to become a real hindrance to making something useful, let alone functional.

And even if most applications would benefit from Core Data at some point, there is wisdom to letting complexity evolve from a simple as necessary. And as far as persistence goes, it doesn’t get much simpler than NSCoding.
